Android application for Himmerland Boligforening

A mobile application developed in collaboration with Himmerland Boligforening for our 4th semester project.
Himmerland Boligforening needed a centrelised and accesible way to share information with their residents.

We developed a mobile application where an admin user can publish information in markdown language and make dropdown items to a residents app.
Each page can be edited and deleted as needed. The backend is build with Firebase firestore as database and Firebase authentication.
The database is secured with security rules which only allow the admin write, edit and delete data.
